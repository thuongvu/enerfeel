		I once performed a experiment: for 21 days, I recorded in a journal all of my daily activities, include meals, exercise, work habits, and energy level.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the days I exercised for 30 minutes, I tended to be more productive. On days I drank coffee, I found an extra-focused 2 1/2 hours of productivity.  Analyzing my days, I gained a new sense of self awareness.

	But what if I could create a tool to track and analyze my productivity? Productive Journal is my answer.
