	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
		I once performed a experiment: for 21 days, I recorded in a journal all of my daily activities, include meals, exercise, work habits, and energy level.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the days I exercised for 30 minutes, I tended to be more productive. On days I drank coffee, I found an extra-focused 2 1/2 hours of productivity.  Analyzing my days, I gained a new sense of self awareness.
	</p>
	But what if I could create a tool to track and analyze my productivity? Productive Journal is my answer.  This page shows sample data for how a user might use this app to find trends in their schedule.

	<p><b>ADD events:</b> From meals, exercising, or anything you choose to track. </p> 

	<p><b>MODIFY events:</b> Make a mistake adding an event?  No problem.  </p>

	<p><b>CREATE:</b> your own categories.  </p>

	<p><b>FILTER:</b> by time (day, week, month, custom!), or activity (meal, exercise, etc).  In the list-view, you can also click Date to show events from a certain date; Time to filter events at a certain time (eg. eating dinner at 7pm everyday), and by category.</p>

	<p><b>SIGN UP:</b> for your own account today!</p>
