Enerfeel
========

I once performed a experiment: for 21 days, I recorded in a journal all of my daily activities, include meals, exercise, work habits, and energy level.  On the days I exercised for 30 minutes, I tended to be more productive. On days I drank coffee, I found an extra-focused 2 1/2 hours of productivity. Analyzing my days, I gained a new sense of self awareness.

But what if I could create a tool to track and analyze my productivity and energy level throughout the day? This app is my answer, and I made it to scratch my own itch.  

It's built on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) with D3.js on top.  

It's deployed at https://productivejournal.com/
